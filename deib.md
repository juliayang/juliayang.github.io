## Commitment to Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging (DEIB) 
 
> We are committed to fostering environments that are professionally and personally inclusive, equitable, psychologically safe, and **welcoming to all teammates**. We do this by leading with **kindness, open-mindedness, and empathy**.  
> 
> 1. **Kindness**: We communicate openly and respectfully, remembering that it is okay for others to have different opinions from us. We treat others with the kindness that we want others to treat us. 
> 2. **Open-mindedness**: We leave assumptions behind, and seek first to understand. We are aware of community biases, actively find new ways to reduce them, and encourage our peers to do the same. 
> 3. **Empathy**:  We always remember that we are on the same team, working together on science and engineering challenges that need our solutions. We give ourselves and others the time, space, and patience to grow and learn.
> 
> These are our guiding principles as **ethical scientists and engineers**.
