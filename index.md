I am an **[Environmental Fellow](https://environment.harvard.edu/environmental-fellows-program)** at Harvard University Center for the Environment (HUCE) working with the **[Materials Intelligence Research](https://mir.g.harvard.edu/)** group since July 2022. Previously, I was a Ph.D. student at University of California, Berkeley with the **[Ceder](https://ceder.berkeley.edu)** group and an AI Resident with **[X](https://x.company/)** (formerly Google X). 

As a **materials scientist working closely with experiments** using computation and machine learning, my research elucidates thermodynamic and kinetic behavior of atoms or molecules to understand and design urgently-needed, sustainable materials for **energy storage and the environment**.

Please see [**here**](JHYang_CV__public_.pdf) for my CV.

## Commitment to Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging (DEIB) 
 
> We are committed to fostering environments that are professionally and personally inclusive, equitable, psychologically safe, and **welcoming to all teammates**. We do this by leading with **kindness, open-mindedness, and empathy**.  
> 
> 1. **Kindness**: We communicate openly and respectfully, remembering that it is okay for others to have different opinions from us. We treat others with the kindness that we want others to treat us. 
> 2. **Open-mindedness**: We leave assumptions behind, and seek first to understand. We are aware of community biases, actively find new ways to reduce them, and encourage our peers to do the same. 
> 3. **Empathy**:  We always remember that we are on the same team, working together on science and engineering challenges that need our solutions. We give ourselves and others the time, space, and patience to grow and learn.
> 
> These are our guiding principles as **ethical scientists and engineers**.
