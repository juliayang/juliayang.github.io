I am an **[Environmental Fellow](https://environment.harvard.edu/environmental-fellows-program)** at Harvard University Center for the Environment (HUCE) working with the **[Materials Intelligence Research](https://mir.g.harvard.edu/)** group since July 2022. Previously, I was a Ph.D. student at University of California, Berkeley with the **[Ceder](https://ceder.berkeley.edu)** group and an AI Resident with **[X](https://x.company/)** (formerly Google X). 

As a **materials scientist working closely with experiments** using computation and machine learning, my research elucidates thermodynamic and kinetic behavior of atoms or molecules to understand and design urgently-needed, sustainable materials for **energy storage and the environment**.
